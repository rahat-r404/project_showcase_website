      <h4>Problem-Based Learning</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        In the context of education, Problem-Based Learning is an instructional
        approach where students learn through actively engaging with real-world
        problems or challenges. Instead of passively receiving information from
        teachers, students are presented with authentic, open-ended problems that
        require critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and
        self-directed learning. In a PBL setting, students work in teams to
        analyze and understand the problem, identify relevant information, propose
        solutions, and apply their knowledge and skills to develop a resolution.
        PBL encourages students to actively explore and investigate the problem,
        ask questions, conduct research, and apply their learning to real-life
        situations. PBL is designed to promote deep learning, critical thinking,
        problem-solving skills, and the ability to transfer knowledge to new
        contexts. It also fosters collaboration, communication, and self-directed
        learning skills, which are valuable in the 21st-century workforce. PBL is
        commonly used in educational settings, including schools, colleges, and
        universities, across various disciplines and subject areas.

      <h4>Robotic</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        A robotic project refers to a project that involves the design,
        development, and implementation of a robot or robotic system. Robotic
        projects can vary widely in scope, complexity, and application, ranging
        from small hobbyist projects to large-scale industrial automation systems.
        Here are some key aspects and considerations in a robotic project: Design:
        The project starts with defining the purpose, goals, and requirements of
        the robot. This includes determining the robot's intended tasks,
        functionality, physical structure, and components. Components and
        Hardware: Selecting and integrating the necessary hardware components such
        as motors, sensors, actuators, microcontrollers or single-board computers,
        power supply, and any other specialized components based on the project
        requirements. Software and Programming: Developing the software that
        controls the robot's behavior and functionality. This involves programming
        the robot using appropriate programming languages, frameworks, or
        development platforms. Common programming languages for robotics projects
        include C++, Python, and ROS (Robot Operating System). Mechanics and
        Assembly: Building or assembling the mechanical structure of the robot
        based on the design. This may involve 3D printing, machining, or using
        off-the-shelf components to create the robot's physical body. Sensing and
        Perception: Integrating sensors to enable the robot to perceive and
        interact with its environment. This can include sensors like cameras,
        proximity sensors, ultrasonic sensors, or specialized sensors based on the
        project requirements.

      <h4>Internet of Things(IOT)</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        IoT stands for the Internet of Things. It refers to a network of physical
        objects or "things" embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that
        enables them to collect and exchange data over the internet. These objects
        can include everyday devices such as smartphones, home appliances,
        wearable devices, vehicles, industrial machinery, and much more. The
        concept behind IoT is to connect and integrate these objects to enable
        them to communicate, interact, and share data with each other and with
        humans. By connecting these devices and enabling them to gather and
        analyze data, IoT aims to enhance efficiency, automation, and
        decision-making across various domains. Key characteristics of IoT
        include: Connectivity: IoT devices are connected to the internet and can
        communicate with other devices, systems, or platforms. Sensors and Data
        Collection: IoT devices are equipped with sensors that can collect data
        such as temperature, humidity, motion, location, and more. Data Processing
        and Analytics: IoT devices can process and analyze the collected data
        locally or in the cloud to derive meaningful insights and make intelligent
        decisions. Automation and Control: IoT enables automation and remote
        control of devices, allowing for efficient monitoring, management, and
        control of various processes. Interoperability: IoT devices and systems
        should be able to work together, exchange data, and operate seamlessly
        across different platforms and technologies. Security and Privacy: IoT
        emphasizes the need for robust security measures to protect data, devices,
        and networks from unauthorized access or misuse. IoT finds applications in
        various sectors, including smart homes, healthcare, transportation,
        agriculture, manufacturing, energy management, environmental monitoring,
        and more. It has the potential to revolutionize industries, improve
        efficiency, optimize resource utilization, and enable innovative services
        and solutions.
